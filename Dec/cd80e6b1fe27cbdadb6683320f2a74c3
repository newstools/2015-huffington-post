No matter how many French macarons or buttercream cupcakes we swoon over (and consume), nothing can take the special place in our hearts that's reserved for brownies. While brownies require no actual pastry-baking skills -- 5-year-old kids can make them with nothing more than a bowl and a plastic spatula -- they satisfy a nostalgic craving for something sugary that's sinfully rich with chocolate. We love that brownie recipes give us a whole lot of reward with little-to-no stress to make. Plus, there's the fact that there are a million ways to make them, so you never tire of eating them. From the classic chocolate to mocha-spiked to peanut-butter loaded, brownies just don't disappoint -- especially these recipes we have for you below. Related on HuffPost:
