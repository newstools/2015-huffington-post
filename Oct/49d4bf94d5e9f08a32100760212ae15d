We've never told you this before, but most kitchens have with their own personal bartender resting on the countertop. It's actually a small kitchen appliance that's most often used to make chilis and stews -- and while it won't listen to how bad your day was like an actual human bartender can, it will make you a warm, toasty drink to take the edge off of that bad day. We're talking about the slow cooker. (And if you don't own one yet, here's the reason you needed to take the plunge). This glorious appliance is perfect for gently warming up fall cocktails that will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. Now sit back and drink a crocktail. Related on HuffPost:
